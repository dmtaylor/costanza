"I don't know.hmmm ha! here's the doctor.",
"I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? I want you to get anything you want'cause I love you so much. I want you to be happy. Okay, sweetie?",
"I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.",
"I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.",
"I don't know how you put up with this.",
"I don't know. I can't believe they're making me take this test.",
"I don't know, I can't eat. You, you can't have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I'm sittin' here with a carrot! They're closing in on a hundred, I'm sayin' to them, 'How can you eat that stuff?'  I'm so sick about losin' that choose, you don't know.",
"I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.",
"I don't know, I didn't ask.",
"I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!",
"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.",
"I don't know. I don't think you're anything.",
"I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those guys.",
"I don't know if you're ready for it.",
"I don't know, I have to call her, tell her where we are. I'm very lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.",
"I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.",
"I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about too much.",
"I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",
"I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.",
"I don't know, I was starving Jerry!",
"I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.",
"I don't know, maybe a safe fell on her head.",
"I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.",
"I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the world this way.",
"I don't know, she lives right around the corner. You could take it here or go to the coffee shop.",
"I don't know, she said she had to pick up a friend of hers at the airport. It cost me a hundred dollars this ticket.",
"I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.",
"I don't know. That's all gonna change.",
"I don't know. They're all very suspicious.",
"I don't know. They're books.",
"I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.",
"I don't know, uh",
"I don't know what'cha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.",
"I don't know, what do women say?",
"I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.",
"I don't know what Newman wanted to see me for.",
"I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there's nothing I can do. It's a machine. The little light is blinking right now, 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's on!",
"I don't know what the reason could be.",
"I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is ridiculous.",
"I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-",
"I don't know. Where's Kramer?",
"I don't know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why don't you get a nurse for mommy? Anyway I was just curious. Remember the other day you were saying something about my trip.",
"I don't know where you're getting this from. I.you're serious aren't you? Oh,  you see? You see, you just don't know my sense of humor. Dan, don't I joke around all the time?",
"I don't know why I bother even talking to you.",
"I don't know why I'm doing this.",
"I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael and Carol.",
"I don't know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.",
"I don't know.. you and Susan Davis?",
"I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.",
"I don't like to discuss figures.",
"I don't like when a woman says, 'Make love to me', it's intimidating. The last time a woman said that to me, I wound up apologizing to her.",
"I don't see any way around it.",
"I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the only reason.",
"I don't see why's she more self-conscious about that than her toe thumbs.",
"I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.",
"I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",
"I don't think it's gonna work out",
"I don't think I've ever spoken to her.",
"I don't think so.",
"I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to talk to you",
"I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.",
"I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. Wait a second, is that him?",
"I don't think we should see each other any more.",
"I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're great but I'm I'm riddled with personal problems.",
"I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.",
"I don't understand.",
"I don't understand, how do these thieves start the car?",
"I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. Listen. Just because I got the guy fired doesn't mean I turned him into a bum - does it?",
"I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.",
"I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? Something must have happened.",
"I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try on pants.",
"I don't understand why you spend time with this guy.",
"I don't understand women.",
"I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?",
"I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.",
"I don't want any mango.",
"I don't want him to!",
"I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.",
"I don't want it to feel good.",
"I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.",
"I don't want to get out of it.",
"I don't want to hear it, Kramer!",
"I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left in the bank.",
"I don't want to talk about it.",
"I don't want to walk that far.",
"I don't want you to call.",
"I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind me of anyone and we love gum.",
"I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.",
"I'd rather go to a hanging.",
"I dunno.",
"I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.",
"I dunno, I'm in a limo. Hello ma? It's me. Guess where I am. In the back of a limo. No, nobody died. It's a long story, I can't tell you now. Because I can't. I said I can't. If I could, I would. Would you stop it? Alright, look, I'm getting off. No, I'm not telling you! How's this? I'm *never* telling you! I don't care! No! Fine! Never!!",
"I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out on me!",
"I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry, there's a void",
"I dunno sometimes",
"I dunno they said maybe.",
"I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.",
"I enjoy understanding.",
"If anybody should be getting more it's you.",
"If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!",
"If anything happens here, can I count on you?",
"I feel alive, Jerry.",
"I feel fat.",
"I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet woman so, we had a little party, with cake and champagne. I made a toast.",
"I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. I I I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!",
"I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!",
"I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.",
"I feel terrible, I can't be responsible for breaking up a marriage. Oh no",
"If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.",
"If I could talk to the guy for just a sec",
"If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.",
"If I do it, will you buy a computer?",
"I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.",
"I find it disorienting. Who buys an umbrella anyway? Y..you get 'em for free in the coffee shop in the metal cans.",
"I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-",
"If I see things as they are, I would ask 'why' or 'why not?",
"If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will tell you this: Unfortunately, we live in a very superficial society. I don't condone it, but it's a fact of life.",
"If I was a different person.",
"If my parents had a mantel, I might be a completely different person.",
"If not mine, whose?",
"If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.",
"If only something like that could happen to me.",
"I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?",
"I forgot who I am! Who am I?!",
"I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?",
"I froze. I think I'm losing it.",
"If she'd just take a plane somewhere.",
"If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with him alone.",
"If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being she'll be very careful",
"If that helps you..",
"If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your friend.",
"If we could just harness this power and use it for our own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.",
"If we decide to go at it.",
"If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.",
"If you don't say anything I will assume it's a plane crash.",
"If you go now, I know what's gonna happen. We'll find the car, Jerry will show up, and then we'll never find you.",
"If you had like five chickens could you tell them apart by just the way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Bak, bak, baak, bak? Cause if they have individual personalities I'm not sure we should be eaten `em. What's the matter with you?",
"if you hadn't come, this whole thing wouldn't have happen",
"If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she's gonna wanna hang around Drexler's funeral home on Ocean Parkway?",
"If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want it, don't worry about it because uh, you know, I, II could take it, you know.",
"If you're in some situation where some fast cash will save your life, I'll give you the code.",
"If you want.",
"I gave her a twenty, she only gave me change for a ten.",
"I gave. I gave everything I could Mrs. Sokol. but nothing was good enough for her.",
"I gave it to Cosmo.",
"I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're thinking: 'That's why I'm not heterosexual'.",
"I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it, and then I get a memo - a memo - telling me to use the men's room in the hall. Well,  I mean we share it with Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!",
"I got a big problem here, Jerry. The tapes are worthless.",
"I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, 'Easy big fella!' And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its' breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!",
"I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.",

"I got nothing.",
"I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.",
"I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.",

"I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.",
"I know less about women than anyone in the world. But one thing I do know is they're not happy if you don't spend the night. It could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide  You're not going anywhere.",

"I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.",

"I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.",
"I know they're in there, the three of them, laughing at me. Together, laughing and lying.",
"I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!",
"I know. This was like a record. My previous record was when Joni Hirsch asked me not to tell anybody that we slept together. Kept a lid on that for about 28 seconds.",
"I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well that's not entirely true.",
"I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one of those little stress dolls. All right. Back to work.",

It's like I was making a prison break, you know, and I'm heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She's firing at me from the guard tower. 'Son of a bang! Son of a boom!'

Buh-bye.",
"No, Lindsay, it was not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage all the time. It was no big thing. That's right. Oh, okay. Buh-bye. I'm back in, she gave me a second chance.",
"No, listen; we are always sitting here, I am always helping you with your girl problems and you are helping me with my girl problems. Where do we end up?",

I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!",

"No t Why should that make any difference to you?",
"No, why, what's happening?",
"Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.",
"Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldn't you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?",
"Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, I'll be on my way.",

"Oh, it's the chicken and the egg",
"Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.",

"Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.",
"Okay. Now, why do I have to see  you?",
"Okay. Okay. Fine.",
"Okay, okay. Look, you do all the talking, okay?",
"Okay, Okay. Who do you think you're talking to? What are ya' you trying to make a joke, because it's not funny. I can tell you that.",
"Okay. OK. I'll choose you. Whaddaya want?",
"Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn't call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, 'I know you're there, I don't know what your story is.' Yesterday, I'm a volcano ' I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, 'Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don't call me back for four days? I don't like coffee, I don't have to come up. I'd like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.",

"Okay, the point is made.",
"Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So maybe we could get together this weekend.",

"Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. Oh,Elaine?",
"Okay, we'll go!",

"Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.' What's a little place that never closes?",

"Was my father wearing a cape?",
"Was she mad?",
"Was she uh, was she a big, uh woman?",
"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you I gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",
"Was the alarm on?",

"We got work to do. What about the meeting?",

"We had sex.",

"Well, as I say, the pink-eye made my visionquite blurry",
"We'll ask him. My dear fellow, where are you dropping us?",
"Well, as much as I enjoy all the good-natured ribbing, nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people I care about.",
"Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",
"Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work  sorry 'bout the set.",
"Well at least you accomplished something. You got fish.",
"Well at least you and I are talking about how there's nothing to talk about.",
"Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the grind'.",
"Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.",
"Well  but how do I get someone else fired?",

"Well, didn't he regift the label maker?",
"Well, did you see it?",
"Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?",
"Well does it say anywhere in the contract about my car being used as a whorehouse? 'Cause I don't remember reading that clause either..",
"Well don't let him take advantage of you like that.",
"Well, don't they make a counter offer? How can they just cancel the whole deal like that? What kind of a maniac is this guy? I mean he just, he says no, and that's it?",
"Well do you want me to take it off?",
"Well, Dr, Allenwood, uhI was hoping to compile an - admittedly, rudimentary - scrapbook of her life. Something that Betsy could have, and hold onto.",
"Well Elaine was supposed to help me.",

"Well, he has to play! He can't just not play. We're playing! Look, I gotta see him, how do I get in touch with him?",
"Well, he is. I, uh, I live around the corner.",
"Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with me  and uh, well, I was the cause of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you  What's with this thing?",
"Well, here we are.",
"Well, here you go. What do you think?",
"Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.",
"Well, he's merry.",
"Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.",
"Well, how about that?",
"Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?",
"Well, how did she react?",
"Well how do you even know it's hers? Maybe it belonged to Carol. Did you see a name on the tube?",
"Well, how good a look did you get?",
"well humm.. lets get some coffee.",
"Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.",
"Well I am. Couldn't you try to go through some of that stuff I put in your shoebox?",
"Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In fact, you might as well call me--",
"Well, I am not going.",
"Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.",
"Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares about your pants size?",
"Well I can't break up with her now.",
"Well, I can't crack this one.",
"Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.",
"Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I'm just gonna be wishing there were walkways. What are you doing?",
"Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie.",
"Well I didn't do it for my mother.",
"Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.",
"Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.",
"Well, I didn't really tell Susan about it, and she doesn't really have anything else to do.",
"Well, I didn't really think about what I was gonna do with all..",
"Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.",
"Well, I didn't want to break our date.",
"Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going to stay?",
"well I don't know if there's gonna be any place to eat up there",
"Well, I don't really like her.",
"Well, I don't see how I'm gonna make December. I mean, I need a little more time. I mean, look at me I'm a nervous wreck. My stomach aches. My neck is killing me. I can't turn. Look. Look.",
"Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.",
"Well I don't think she is a multiple sneezer, because she sneezed again later, and it was also a single.",
"Well I don't want to get into a big dispute about the pants.",
"Well, I do what I can.",
"Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.",
"Well, if he can regift, why can't you degift?",
"Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?",
"Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, then I'd really have something goin'.",
"Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my advice to you is to finish your meal, pay your check, leave here, and never mention this to anyone again.",
"Well, if it doesn't concern me, then I can stay.",
"Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.",
"Well if she can't tell 'six' from 'sex' then how is she going to lip read from across the room?",
"Well, if she keeps horsing around with that tractor--",
"Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist",
"Well if you and I ever got into, like a really serious fight you know, and the punches started flying -- who do you think would win?",
"Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?",
"Well, if you must know, shhhe, was my fianc&eacute;e, Susan. May she rest in peace.",
"Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer! Huh? We can check porn, and stock quotes.",
"Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!",
"Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer enters)",
"Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila.",
"Well I gotta go talk to Beth.",
"Well I gotta undo what I did.",
"Well, I guess I'm getting older.",
"Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.",
"Well, I guess these would be out of the question.",
"Well, I have to see her.",
"Well, I heard a noise.",
"Well I-I",
"Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.",
"Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.",
"Well, I, I got the pilot of the Jerry show.",
"Well, I-I just recently uh",
"Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.",
"Well, I join them in their grief.",
"Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold",
"Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.",
"Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.",
"Well I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they didn't move.",
"Well I know how to drive.",
"Well, I know when I'm a little strapped, I sometimes drop off my rent check having forgotten to sign it. That could buy us some time.",
"Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.",
"Well I like Dylan.",
"Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.",
"WellI'll ask Susan about it later.",
"Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift.",
"Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never doing.. that , again.",
"Well I'm addicted",
"Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?",
"Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. Now the torch will burn forever.",
"Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to I've never done a 'solid' before.",
"Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?",
"Well, I'm here. What is it?",
"Well, I might be getting into that.",
"Well, I'm, I'm just looking.",
"Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.",
"Well, I'm mentioning his name.",
"Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?",
"Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!",
"Well, I'm satisfied. Uhmy back iskilling me.",
"Well, I'm sorry!",
"..Well. I'm sorry. Call you right back.",
"Well, I'm sorry, Timmybut I don't dip that way.",
"Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!",
"Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and 1200--somewhere--there were two women living together.",
"Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--",
"Well I'm sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about your cycles.",
"Well, I'm sure you'll find something.",
"Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise, what's the point of being the boyfriend? This is where you have to be when you're the boyfriend.",
"Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?",
"Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.",
"Well, is he good, Kramer?",
"Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!",
"Well I spoke to Elaine",
"Well, I started to tell her and then all of the sudden, for some reason, I just burst into tears.",
"Well, I still don't know what I'm supposed to do. I don't even know what my assignment is.",
"Well I still think it was wrong.",
"Well, I still think you shoulda told me.",
"Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have to have someone explain the explanation.",
"Well, it comes and goes.",
"Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe I could be like, an announcer. Like a color man. You know how I always make those interesting comments during the game.",
"Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.",
"Well, it happened again.",
"Well I think I'm better off going one-on-one.",
"Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.",
"Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave it?",
"Well, I think this is it.",
"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uhJoe Pepitone Day. Or, uhJon Voight Day.",
"Well, I think you're wrong about that. And ah now if you'll excuse me, I'd really like to get started, please.",
"Well, I think you should drop him down to Step Two.",
"Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.",
"Well, I took the liberty of packing your things. Mom's coming to get you.",
"Well, it's about Holly Go-Lightly.",
"Well, it's a funny idea.",
"Well, it's a good looking piece of meat. Wow, this is some place. A duplex, huh? Look at this, you got stairs in an apartment. All my life, I dreamed about having steps in an apartment. Even one step. Sunken living room. Although, one step is really not all that sunken.",
"Well it's a little strange. You going to start to talk like Elaine from now on?",
"Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.",
"Well, it's all over. I slipped up.",
"Well it's a magnificent stone.",
"Well, it's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding on a new face.",
"Well, it's definetly him.",
"Well, it's getting dark.",
"Well, it's just a game. Remember that, kids.",
"Well, it's just, all you said was 'your welcome', which is nice. It's very nice. But I feel I gotta get the apology.",
"Well, it's kind of a mystery, isn't it?",
"Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!",
"Well, it's much too low.",
"Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",
"Well it's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it to follow somebody?",
"Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!",
"Well it's not really damaged. 85 dollars huh?",
"Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were both uh",
"Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.",
"Well it's over. It's definitely over.",
"Well, it's the damnedest thing. The cat dies. So she comes back into town, she finds the cat lying on the carpet stiff as a board.",
"Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. It's like right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off in an alcove. You understand? There's no buffer zone. So, we start to fool around, and it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin to perceive this impending intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to surpass by great lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have to stop. And as this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage to momentarily extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable force, I know that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that I know I'm going to need",
"Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.",
"Well, it's true. I saw it.",
"WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?",
"Well, it was a hell of a ride.",
"Well it was a helluva yada yada.",
"Well, it was slightly used",
"Well, it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be careful, there's a lot of nuts out there. All right you have everything?",
"Well, it worked when I met George Peppard last week.",
"Well, it would be OK if Darryl was here.",
"Well, it wouldn't fit you. The sleeves are too short.",
"Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's M&eacute;nage &agrave; Trois?",
"Well I've done that.",
"Well, I've given this a lot of thought, and I've gotta say",
"WellI've got a lot to do!",
"Well I've never met your sister but obviously these are not hard-and-fast rules. Darling, the tea is getting a little cold sweetheart.",
"Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in every database in town!",
"Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan up at the office.",
"Well, I wanna talk to him about this.",
"Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.",
"Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --",
"Well I was dropping of the calzone money for the week. Um shouldn't you be at work by now?",
"Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.",
"WellI was in the locker room showering, and II had to go, so",
"Well I was just going to wander the streets. Don't wanna tag along with you or anything.",
"Well? I was just - I'm curious, that's all. We, uh. We'd like you to, do everything possible.",
"Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way, you mind if I watch it here?",
"Well, I was very comfortable! I've got my nuts here",
"Well, I was wondering",
"Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!",
"Well I would eat you.",
"Well, I wouldn't want you to do that. You know there's a lot of losers out there.",
"Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.",
"Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can go with George Costanza.",
"Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other driver doesn't have any insurance, so the judge",
"Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance I was never gonna have sex again anyway.",
"We'll just take a check. (She leaves the check. George, in all his cheapness, can't help but to review the check. He finds an error) You made a mistake on the..",
"Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?",
"Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.",
"Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.",
"Well, last night she told me that she liked you. Not you, the disturbed you, so I had to tell her the truth.",
"Well let me hear.",
"Well, let me. Heh. Let me just eh.. check an', make sure I have the right man--ha! Heh, heh, heh! Seems--oh! I, oh!",
"Well, let's just leave.",
"Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. ?",
"Well, live and learn.",
"Well, look at this. This doesn't belong here! Someone has made a terrible mistake.",
"Well, losing a loved is, uhI mean, forget about it.",
"Well, Marisa. See, the thing is I'm sort of engaged.",
"Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!",
"Wellmaybe not as much as this bastard  I can hold my own!",
"Well, maybe not married, but",
"Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the Monday after the weekend.",
"Well, maybe sobut it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.",
"Well, maybe they're done with it. I could go pick it up.",
"Well, maybe you could show me something else.",
"Well, me neither.",
"Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. I'm looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, I'm afraid this is not going to work out  Thanks for coming in.",
"Well, my bed is too small.",
"Well, my father works for the United Volunteers, maybe he can get her one.",
"Well, my mother, Jerry..",
"Well, no.",
"Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps  I-I'll reimburse you of course.",
"Well nothing. I didn't actually say that.",
"Wellnot 'out.' She's a prisoner.",
"Well, not really. After all, she did get together with George Peppard. I mean, Fred.",
"Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant cravingbut I haven't yearned.",
"Well , not yet.. Fianc&eacute;.",
"Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose all its cachet!",
"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. 'By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there.' 'Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.",
"Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually failed me in gym. ME!",
"Well, okay.",
"Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But",
"Well, people never give a good 'hello' at a funeral. I mean, they go like this  That's the biggest.",
"Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know the basic plot. Yeah.",
"Well, personal, I mean, we both uh",
"Well played.",
"Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why don't we test your bladder system at my office?",
"Well, Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office. They tried to sweat me out.",
"Well, possibly. I wrote an off-Broadway show, 'La Cocina.' ..Actually, it was off-off-Broadway. It was a comedy about a Mexican chef.",
"Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..",
"We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.",
"Well, scintillating as always.",
"Well seems it's about time for George's lunch.",
", we'll see you in a little while.",
"Well she apologized, and then she wanted to know if we could get together Wednesday afternoon.",
"Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.",
"Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm.",
"Well, she probably just assumed.",
"Well, she's smart. You take my word for it.",
"Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.",
"Well, should I call you later?",
"Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.",
"Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.",
"Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.",
"Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom.",
"Well, some women like it.",
"Well, so much for purification week.",
"Well, sorry I missed that, uh, charity thing. But this was one of those truly glorious Hampton weekends that you always hear about.",
"Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.",

"Yeah, I better grab some too.",
"Yeah. I can't get over it.",
"Yeah, I didn't mean that.",
"Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. Can I borrow your menu?",
"Yeah. I don't think they'll be able to tell.",

"Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who answers the phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better tell him I'm expecting a call.",
"Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl",
"Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. Not, uh, too expensive, is it?",

"Yeah. Let's go.",
"Yeah, like he was really gonna take your money.",
"Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.",
"Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees to make a few extra bucks.",
"Yeah, like that.",
"Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes, but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's like a power struggle and the second toe assumes control of the foot.",
"Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.",
"Yeah! Look at me! I was free and clear! I was living the dream! I was stripped to the waist, eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery!",

"Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad  and a cup of tea.",
"Yeah, no pop-in, no 'in the neighborhood,' no 'I saw your light was on.' And the best part is, if things go really well",
"Yeah. No problem.",
"Yeah. Not only that, this is what she said to me, 'Can we change the subject?",
"Yeah. Not that I care, one way or the other, but these doctors today really do amazing things, you know, if you were so inclined. And again, I'm not suggesting.",
"Yeah, now I gotcha!",
"Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?",
"Yeah. Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.",

She's like an expensive car with one of those motion-sensor force field alarms. Any sudden movement in the area could set her off.",

This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.",
"Yes, a rosy glow.",
"Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it.
